# This is the program that will parse through all of the un read data in the data drop folder
# and insert it into the sqllilte database that will be located in this directory.

# Making sure that no duplicate data is inserted and that all of the data is parsed through and
# Categorized correctly with the proper standardized names for each item.
# This categorization of the data could potentially be done with ai processing by feeding in the 
# name of the listing and ask the ai how many GB does it have, What edition is it, etc depending 
# on the type of listing. 

# Depending on the type of listing that I am searching for will depend on what the prompt will be
# inserted into the ai model for processing.
